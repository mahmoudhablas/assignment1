# 1-what is class ?
### -A class is used to specify the form of an object and it combines data representation and methods for manipulating that data into one neat package. The data and functions within a class are called members of the class.
 
# 2- How does a class accomplish abstraction ,encapsulation ,and data hiding?
### Abstraction and encapsulation are complementary concepts: abstraction focuses on the observable behavior of an object... encapsulation focuses upon the implementation that gives rise to this behavior... encapsulation is most often achieved through information hiding, which is the process of hiding all of the secrets of object that do not contribute to its essential characteristics.
### Data hiding means to hide the members of the class and providing the access to only some of them. we can make the members of the class private or public. in private,the outside world cannot access those members .but in public all members can access them.
# 3-what is the relation between class and object?
### class defined the properties and behavior for the objects.
# 4-In what way, aside from being functions, are class function members different from class data members?

###  data members are the parameters of the class but function members are the methods that be implemented.
# 6-When are class constructors called? When are class destructors called?
### contructor called  when the class is created.destructors are called at the end of it to delete some **pointers** from memory.


# 8- What is a default constructor? What is the advantage of having one?
### is the contructor that takes no parameters .used to intialize.
# 10-What are this and *this?
### if a function return this ,it will pointer to the current object,but *this  ,it will be a clone of the current object.
